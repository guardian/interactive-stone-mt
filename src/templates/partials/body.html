                <p><span class='uit-drop'><span class='uit-drop__inner'>S</span></span>tone Mountain is a massive geological aberration. Often incorrectly identified as granite, the exposed rock is technically a “quartz monzonite dome monadnock” that extends underground for miles in every direction. The visible portion rises 1,686 feet (514 m) above sea level, or 825 feet (251 m) above the Georgia Piedmont. Located fourteen miles east of downtown Atlanta, it sits within a 3,200-acre (1,294 ha) forest-dubbed-theme-park that is owned by the State of Georgia and managed by the Stone Mountain Memorial Association. It is cited as “Georgia's most visited attraction, drawing nearly 4 million guests each year.” Best known for its laser-light show that runs every night throughout the summer, the park also offers hiking, fishing, camping, paddle boats, an excursion train, a golf course, a lodge, educational exhibits, and a handful of memorials to white supremacy.</p>

                <p>The icon of Stone Mountain Park is one of those memorials. It’s also the largest bas-relief sculpture in the world. Occupying the steep northern slope of the mountain and measuring 76 feet (23 m) tall by 158 feet (48 m) wide, the carving depicts the President of the Confederate States of America, Jefferson Davis, along with Confederate Generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. They are riding their favorite horses, (Blackjack, Traveller, and Little Sorrel, respectively), with their hats over their hearts. Maybe they’re trotting north to rejoin the Union, but like most Civil War memorials, their real purpose is to instill in us a 20th century romanticized narrative about the American South that helps maintain white supremacy through a segregated and unequal society.</p>
